ðŸ”„ End-to-End Flow of the Project
1. Backend Preparation (Before Flask App)
    You trained multiple regression models (LinearRegression, RandomForest, XGBoost, etc.).
    Saved each model as a .pkl file (using pickle).
    Evaluated models (MAE, MSE, RÂ²) and saved results in a CSV (model_evaluation_results.csv).

2. Flask App Setup
    app.py is the main file that connects everything:
    Loads all models from .pkl.
    Loads evaluation results CSV into a Pandas DataFrame.
    Creates routes (/, /predict, /results).

3. Routes & Workflow
    (a) Home Page (/)
        User sees a form (index.html).
        Form contains:
        Dropdown â†’ Select model name.
        Input fields â†’ Income, House Age, Rooms, Bedrooms, Population.
        User fills data & submits.

    (b) Prediction (/predict)
        Flask takes submitted form values.
        Converts them into a Pandas DataFrame (input_df).
        Picks the correct ML model from dictionary (models[model_name]).
        Calls .predict(input_df) â†’ gets predicted House Price.
        Sends the result + model name to results.html â†’ displays prediction.

    (c) Model Evaluation Results (/results)
        Loads the CSV (model_evaluation_results.csv).
        Converts DataFrame into an HTML table.
        Displays it on model.html.
        User can compare modelsâ€™ performance (MAE, MSE, RÂ²) side by side.

4. User Experience
    User opens the app â†’ selects model + enters values.
    App predicts and shows House Price.
    User can also check /results to see which model performs best.
    This lets the user try different models and compare prediction results.

5. Big Picture

    Inputs (User data) â†’ Flask â†’ Correct Model â†’ Prediction â†’ Results Page
    Extra Route â†’ Model Evaluation Results â†’ Compare Models

âš¡ In one line:
ðŸ‘‰ Your project is an interactive Flask web app where users can pick any regression model, enter house-related features, get predictions for house prices, and compare modelsâ€™ performance.
